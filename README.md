K9's stupid python script to auto-download Minecraft mods from Modrinth

I made this for shits and giggles. Code originally based off of [@tympanicblock61](https://github.com/tympanicblock61/)'s [modrinth-downloader](https://github.com/tympanicblock61/modrinth-downloader)

Format for `modlist.txt` should be like this:

```
Bad Packets
Better Beds
Better Ping Display
```

Just the names of the mods should do. The script automatically queries Modrinth for the slugs.
